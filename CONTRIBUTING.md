# **Contributing to MCP Discovery**

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for your interest in improving **MCP Discovery**! Every contribution, big or small, is valuable and appreciated.

## **Code of Conduct**

We follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). Please be respectful and inclusive when contributing.

## **How to Contribute**

### Participating in Tests and Documentation

We highly encourage contributors to improve test coverage and enhance documentation.

### Participating in Issues

You can contribute in three key ways:

1. **Report Issues** â€“ If you find a bug or have an idea, open an issue for discussion.
2. **Help Triage** â€“ Provide details, test cases, or suggestions to clarify issues.
3. **Resolve Issues** â€“ Investigate problems and submit fixes via Pull Requests (PRs).

Anyone can participate at any stage, whether it's discussing, triaging, or reviewing PRs.

### **Filing a Bug Report**

When reporting a bug, use the provided issue template and fill in as many details as possible. Donâ€™t worry if you canâ€™t answer everythingâ€”just provide what you can.

### **Fixing Issues**

Most issues are resolved through a Pull Request. PRs go through a review process to ensure quality and correctness.

## **Pull Requests (PRs)**

We welcome PRs! Before submitting, please:

1. **Discuss major changes** â€“ Open an issue before adding a new feature and opening a PR.
2. **Create a feature branch** â€“ Fork the repo and branch from `main`.
3. **Write tests** â€“ If your change affects functionality, add relevant tests.
4. **Update documentation** â€“ If you modify APIs, update the docs.
5. **Run checks** â€“ Ensure code consistency, formatting, and pass all validations by running:

```sh
cargo make check
```

### **Commit Best Practices**

- **Relate PR changes to the issue** â€“ Changes in a pull request (PR) should directly address the specific issue itâ€™s tied to. Unrelated changes should be split into separate issues and PRs to maintain focus and simplify review.
- **Logically separate commits** â€“ Keep changes atomic and easy to review.
- **Maintain a bisect-able history** â€“ Each commit should compile and pass all tests to enable easy debugging with `git bisect` in case of regression.
